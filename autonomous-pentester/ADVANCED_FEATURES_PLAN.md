# Advanced Features Plan for Autonomous Pentester

## Objective
Enhance the autonomous penetration testing system to be competitive with XBOW and capable of climbing to number 1 on HackerOne by implementing advanced AI models, real-world target prioritization, scalable infrastructure, and HackerOne API integration.

## Features and Components

### 1. Advanced AI/ML Models
- Integrate pre-trained or custom-trained AI models for vulnerability detection.
- Use datasets from public vulnerability databases and CTF challenges.
- Implement continuous learning and model updates based on new findings.
- Use NLP models for parsing bug bounty scopes and policies.

### 2. Real-World Target Ingestion and Prioritization
- Parse bug bounty program scopes and policies (machine-readable and manual curation).
- Expand subdomains and assets using DNS enumeration and crawling.
- Implement scoring system based on:
  - Target appearance and technology stack
  - Presence of WAFs and protections
  - HTTP status codes and redirect behavior
  - Authentication forms and reachable endpoints
- Deduplicate targets using content similarity (SimHash) and visual similarity (imagehash).

### 3. Scalable Infrastructure
- Use asynchronous and distributed scanning architecture.
- Implement task queues and worker pools.
- Efficient resource management and error handling.
- Duplicate detection and grouping of similar vulnerabilities.

### 4. HackerOne API Integration
- Automate vulnerability submission and tracking.
- Comply with program policies and rate limits.
- Implement pre-submission validation and peer review.
- Track vulnerability status and update reports accordingly.

### 5. Additional Features
- Automated peer review using AI and programmatic checks.
- Reporting dashboard or enhanced CLI with detailed analytics.
- Logging, alerting, and notification system.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: AI Model Integration and Target Prioritization
- Integrate AI models for scanning.
- Implement target ingestion and scoring.

### Phase 2: Scalable Infrastructure and Validation
- Build async scanning and validation modules.
- Implement deduplication and error handling.

### Phase 3: HackerOne API Integration and Automation
- Integrate HackerOne API for submissions.
- Implement compliance and tracking.

### Phase 4: Additional Features and Optimization
- Add peer review automation.
- Build reporting dashboard.
- Optimize performance and robustness.

## Dependencies and Tools
- Python AI/ML libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Playwright for validation
- Async frameworks (asyncio, Celery)
- HackerOne API client
- Image processing libraries (Pillow, imagehash)
- Logging and monitoring tools

## Follow-up Steps
- Review and approve plan.
- Begin Phase 1 implementation.
- Provide regular updates and demos.
